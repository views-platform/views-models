This is a repository containing the notebook for the pipeline comparison of the old and the new pipeline on the country-month level.
We only compare state-based violence. 
This is NOT production code and is never intended to be production code (see https://github.com/views-platform/docs/blob/main/ODRs/general_003_no_jupyter_notebooks_in_production.md)
It purely serves the purpose of the visualizing the pipeline comparison.
